- test: test "$str1" = "$str2" == [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]
- \[\[]]: is key word in bash, \[\[ "$str1" == "$str2" ]] == [ "$str1" = "$str2" ]


see more about test command in 6.2, table 6.6

### switch

case $1 in
-f)
    ...
	;;
-d | --directory)

for i in "$@"; do
    case $i in
	-f) ...
	    ;;

an easy way is use command "getopts", see in 6.4
