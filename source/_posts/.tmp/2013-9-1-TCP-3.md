### Timeout and Retransmission

TCP manage four different timers for each connection:

- A retransmission timer: for acknowledgment
- A persist timer: for keeping window size information
- A keepalive timer: for detacting other end crashes or reboots
- A 2MSL timer: `TIME_WAIT`

#### congestion avoidance algorithm

round-trip time(RTT)

**Congestion avoidance** and **slow start** are independent algorithms with different objectives.
But when congestion occurs we want to slow down the transmission rate of packets into the network,
and then invoke slow start to get things going again.
